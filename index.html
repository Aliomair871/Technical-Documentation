       <p>HTML is a relatively easy language and does not require any formal education. So basically, there are no prerequisites for learning it.

HTML is text-based computer coding, and anyone can learn and run it, as long as they understand letters and basic symbols. So, all you need is basic computer knowledge and the ability to work with files.

Of course, any knowledge of other programming languages will enhance your abilities with HTML and web development, but this is not a prerequisite for learning HMTL.

            CSS is considered to be one of the easiest languages to learn. Its basic rules and syntax are simple, and you could start styling web pages after a single day of learning (if you’re already familiar with HTML). It may take longer to learn its more advanced features, but once you do, the same rules apply.

While CSS is a relatively simple language, its capabilities have evolved over the years. Here are some of the most popular ways CSS is used.
